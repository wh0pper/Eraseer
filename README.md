## Description
What began as an IOT application for stress management later evolved into a mobile game played by groups of 2-5, that hacks iTag Bluetooth Low-Energy Buttons as controllers. The app pairs with available iTags and uses these as a game controller.

## Objectives

**Phase One Objectives**
- To create an app that will scan for, pair with, and listen for updates from a bluetooth device.

* User can press a button to record a timestamp
* Recorded clicks are stored in the app

**Phase Two Objectives**
- To create a piece of smart hardware that can take user clicks from a button and send timestamps via bluetooth to a paired app.

* User can turn on device and pair with the app on their smartphone
* User can click a button on the device
* User clicks are sent as timestamps to the paired smartphone
